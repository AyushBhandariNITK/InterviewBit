<h2>How to contribute?</h2>

   1. Fork the repository<br>
   2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)<br>
   3. Make a pull request<br>

<h2>When to contribute?</h2>

   1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.<br>
   2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.<br>
   3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size.<br>
      In this case, comment out the original solution & make a pull request with your solution.<br>
   4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the<br> 
      original method then, comment your solution in the main file & make a pull request.<br>
